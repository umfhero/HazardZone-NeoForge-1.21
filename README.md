**HazardMod** is a WIP Minecraft mod for NeoForge 1.21 focused on post-apocalyptic themes, mutation systems, and hazardous environments. The core design is open-ended and evolving. Expect experiments with custom mobs, dangerous biomes, gear progression, and contamination mechanics.

# Concept Overview


> [!NOTE]
> This mod is still in its early development stage. All content is subject to change. Features, items, and names are placeholders or prototypes.
> 


HazardMod is being built as a flexible framework for mutant survival gameplay. Current plans may include:

- Radiation or contamination zones  
- Mutant-inspired mobs  
- Protective gear and utility items  
- Biome effects or altered worldgen  
- Progression through crafting, research, or DNA manipulation  

The goal is to create a mod that's both standalone-compatible and modpack-friendly.

# ðŸ§ª Development Goals

While no core features are final, the intended direction includes:

â€¢ Hazardous environments that affect player behaviour  
â€¢ Unique mob types with mutations or behaviour variants  
â€¢ Equipment or crafting systems tied to survival and control  
â€¢ Support for datapacks, JEI, and modpack scripting  
â€¢ Visual and gameplay feedback that makes danger feel immersive  

Everything is still subject to design iteration.
